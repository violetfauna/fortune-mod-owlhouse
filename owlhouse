Let see what kind of witch you are. —Amity Blight
%
Not so fast! I'm not letting you get away so easily. I. Want. My. Badge! —Amity Blight
%
Willow! Wow, you're so unnoticeable I almost rolled into you! —Amity Blight
%
As "Top Student", it is my duty to tell you to keep at it! Even you could get a passing grade someday! —Amity Blight
%
Humans have no magical ability. But I doubt that'll stop you. —Amity Blight
%
Show me what you got, human! —Amity Blight
%
You think it's so easy to be a witch. I have been working my whole life to get to the top! You lost! You cheated! Say it! Say you're not a witch! —Amity Blight
%
So, you two go to the same school now, that doesn't change anything. —Amity Blight
%
Because this isn't just some dance party...That's Grom, short for Grometheus the Fear Bringer. It's a monster that lives under the school. Every year it tries to break out and a student has to defeat it. Ever the optimist, Bump holds a party and calls it tradition. The worst thing is that Grom can read minds and shapeshift into your worst nightmare and mine... is very embarrassing. —Amity Blight
%
Luz I don't think you're ready, but we're literally out of time. —Amity Blight
%
Me, on a team- with you? Running around in- cute uniforms- sweating?- I gotta go! —Amity Blight
%
Pfft- I'm fine, hahaha! Wh- Who's Amity? —Amity Blight
%
Oh... wow, sports! —Amity Blight
%
Shut up. —Amity Blight
%
Yi Yi, Mama is I. And I is the Bat Queen. —Bat Queen
%
To be careless with a staff, it's very serious. I protect him. —Bat Queen
%
Owl Lady is careless. Her staff left her sight. Taken by human who steals, hurts, frightens... —Bat Queen
%
No! More trails. Last trial. You must face me. —Bat Queen
%
Yes, I was once part of a grand staff. A staff made for a giant. But I was broken, discarded. —Bat Queen
%
I made home in forest. I'm here to take the lost. The forgotten. —Bat Queen
%
It has been thousands of years. I've forgotten. —Bat Queen
%
Yes, consume. Grow wise. Avoid paper-cuts. —Bat Queen
%
Sorry you couldn't get an invite to the conjuring, Willow, only real witches allowed. —Boscha
%
Ugh! Yes, Mom. I'm going to a moonlight conjuring. No, Mom. You can't come. And yes, Mom, it's sad that you're asking. —Boscha
%
Ew. A talking house is giving me a lecture? Whatever. I'll just TP you like I did with the rest of the neighborhood. —Boscha
%
Ugh. So what if we couldn't move a doll. Now we have time for what really matters... Penstagram! —Boscha
%
I'm just here to take an ironic Penstagram next to your weird flashing trash sign. —Boscha
%
New post: Loser human thinks she can hang out in our sacred Treasure Shack. Spoiler alert: She can't. —Boscha
%
Enough! I don't know why they can't remember what a weirdo loser you are, but I'm gonna help them remember. —Boscha
%
Luz, I challenge you to a race... around Dead Man's Curve. —Boscha
%
Too wiggly, too obvious, now we're talkin'! I think today is a talons day - rawr! —Boscha
%
It's so weird that a human goes here now. Too bad she's already burned her social life at the stake, any friend of Willow's is an automatic dork. —Boscha
%
Ugh! Skara! Why did you give me an invite that was molting? Gross! Give me another one. —Boscha
%
I can't believe she'd even hang out with her! It's just embarrassing. "Oh look at me! I'm going on a date with my ferns!" —Boscha
%
Why do you look like you've seen a ghost? Is there a ghost in photo class? Are they cute?! —Boscha
%
You are talented. You are a star. You may be hated, so long as you are feared. Most important of all, you are a winner. —Boscha
%
It’s weird that Amity hangs out with you now. Ever since Grom, she’s gone soft. But don’t worry. I’m still here to show you who’s boss. —Boscha
%
Ok, maybe it’s the altitude of the second floor, but I thought I heard you say that leaf girl wants to challenge ME to a grudgby match. —Boscha
%
Yeah, while you were celebrating your “victory”, I caught this guy. It means I automatically win. All magic sports are like this. —Boscha
%
Well, we beat them and proved our social dominance. All is right in the hierarchy. —Boscha
%
Ugh, I want my own Palisman, not some trashy hand-me-down. —Boscha
%
Outta my way! I want to play professional Grudgby —Boscha
%
Mija, I love your creativity, but it's gotten out of hand. Do you remember why you were in the principal's office the last three times? —Camila Noceda
%
We all love that you express yourself, but if you can't learn to separate fantasy from reality, you may need to spend the summer here. —Camila Noceda
%
Cuídate mucho, mija. ¡Qué te vaya bien! —Camila Noceda
%
I'm Eda, the Owl Lady. The most powerful witch on the Boiling Isles. —Eda Clawthorne
%
This is the Boiling Isles. Every myth you humans have is caused by a little of our world leaking into yours. —Eda Clawthorne
%
Oh, look at us, Luz. King and I don't have much in this world. We only have each other. So if that dumb crown is important to him, it's important to me. And beside, us weirdos have to stick together, you know? —Eda Clawthorne
%
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, kid. Being a witch doesn't happen overnight. Also, you're wrapped in a bathrobe and wearing the dirtiest traffic cone I've ever seen. —Eda Clawthorne
%
Remember, never befriend a man in sandals. And always measure twice, cut once. —Eda Clawthorne
%
Oh, you guys talking about bad girls? —Eda Clawthorne
%
Look, kid, everyone wants to believe they are "chosen". But if we all waited around for a prophecy to make us special, we'd die waiting. And that's why you need to choose yourself. —Eda Clawthorne
%
No! WHY?! SCHOOL!!! —Eda Clawthorne
%
It sparkles and shimmers. It shines and delights. I must have it for my nest... —Eda Clawthorne
%
I respect your cunning, but I also hate you for it. —Eda Clawthorne
%
When I was younger, I was cursed. I don't know exactly how it happened, all I know is that if I don't take my elixir... Well, that's why people call me the Owl Lady. No one likes having a curse, but if you take the right steps, it's manageable. —Eda Clawthorne
%
Watch closely, Luz. When you join a coven, all your other magic is sealed away. From now on, that kid will only be able to make illusions. Since I never joined a coven, I can do every kind of magic. That's why I'm the most powerful witch on the Boiling Isles. —Eda Clawthorne
%
Now I'm coming at you with a blast of fire. What do you do? —Eda Clawthorne
%
Ah hah! Yes yes yes yes yes, you cheated! Perfect, prissy Lilith cheated. Hot dang I love coventions! —Eda Clawthorne
%
What? I don't know. And who's a true witch? These suckers? According to them, that means being in a coven, but I never joined one and I'm better than all of them combined. You gotta be your own witch. —Eda Clawthorne
%
I know I should be repulsed, but that look is fierce. —Eda Clawthorne
%
You can’t scam a scammer! —Eda Clawthorne
%
Dumb kids? Wait... Those are my dumb kids! —Eda Clawthorne
%
There is one way, but it’s terribly dangerous and partially illegal... so you’re in the right place! —Eda Clawthorne
%
Is that supposed to be me? Dang, I look great. —Eda Clawthorne
%
Now, what's the fun in watching a kid get eaten by a monster if its my kid? —Eda Clawthorne
%
Dang it, Luz! Your nonsense has gotten into my head. Well, time to do this the old-fashioned way. —Eda Clawthorne
%
Ugh. Go on, do the parallel arm thing... —Eda Clawthorne
%
But then how pathetic are you, that you can't best me at my worst?! —Eda Clawthorne
%
I AM BETTER THAN YOU!!! —Eda Clawthorne
%
Alright, kid, listen to me. I'm going away, and I don't know if I can bounce back this time. Watch over King, remember to feed Hooty. And Luz, thank you for being in my life. —Eda Clawthorne
%
I love you too, kiddo. —Eda Clawthorne
%
You gonna let her get to you like that? —Edric Blight
%
We don't hang out in the library. "Uh, teacher, I'm in love with a dictionary." —Edric Blight
%
Mittens has gotten too full of herself. She keeps tattling on us when we cut class. —Edric Blight
%
I'm Emira. And this is Edric. We're Amity's older siblings. We heard how you embarrassed her at the school and at the witch covention last week. No wonder she hates you. —Emira Blight
%
Don't waste your time with Mittens. Me and Ed, we are way more fun. Follow us. —Emira Blight
%
We're her family. It's tough love. She needs to learn to lighten up —Emira Blight
%
Just a moment, Lilith. —Emperor Belos
%
I'm getting bored of your excuses, Lilith. —Emperor Belos
%
I will know. —Emperor Belos
%
This is the Titan's will. All wild witches must be dealt with with before the day of unity. —Emperor Belos
%
Okay, I'll play. —Emperor Belos
%
What's wrong, human? I thought you wanted to fight? —Emperor Belos
%
I like your spirit. But try that again and things won't end well, for you. —Emperor Belos
%
You probably think we want to invade the human realm, but the Titan's will is not so borish. —Emperor Belos
%
The Titan will be pleased. —Emperor Belos
%
The Day of Unity is almost upon us, and we have much work to do. —Emperor Belos
%
Knock Knock...Human. —Emperor Belos
%
And so is watching you fail. I know you can do better, Hunter. —Emperor Belos
%
Espérate un momento, this isn't camp. Have you been here, all these weeks? And is that a weapon? —Grometheus the Fear Bringer
%
Mija, have you been lying to me?! —Grometheus the Fear Bringer
%
Why are you running, Luz? —Grometheus the Fear Bringer
%
Why can't you face me, Luz? Why can't you face your own mother? —Grometheus the Fear Bringer
%
How can you say that, Cariño?! You're breaking my heart! —Grometheus the Fear Bringer
%
Did you know that humans nail barbed wire to their kids' teeth? But why? Maybe to make them magnetic. —Gus Porter
%
Behold. The wonders of the human realm. This little fellow is one of their most valued objects. It aids in the compiling of printed wisdom, the scratching of gunk from under your nails, and my favorite‐‐ It even mimics the sounds of the human ocean. —Gus Porter
%
Being younger than everyone is hard. You're overlooked. Ignored. But at the H. A. S. I mattered. I could make sure no one would ever get left behind. I didn't wanna lose that. I'm sorry. —Gus Porter
%
Hoot hoot, password please! —Hooty
%
Alright, alright! Geez! You never want to have any fun! Ow! Hoot! —Hooty
%
Hoot, hoot. If you want the answer that you seek, solve my riddle within a week‐‐ Ow! Okay, okay. She went into the forest towards Bonesborough. Sheesh! —Hooty
%
I heard her tiny mouse feet walking close by. Or that might've been some mice. Anyway, someone started moving in that direction. —Hooty
%
Hoot! Well, hurry it up with that force field! That rain is getting closer to my precious stucco. —Hooty
%
No, let her try. It'll be funny. —Hooty
%
Hey, hey! Is anyone there? Hello? Hoot? I'm on the floor. It's cold! —Hooty
%
Finally I get to be a part of something! —Hooty
%
Hoot hoot. I don't need a babysitter, I'm a big boy house! —Hooty
%
Company! Hooray! Finally someone to listen to my stories! Okay, one time, a sparrow flew into my mouth, and then I... Hey... —Hooty
%
By the power of moonlight, I have risen. Hoot hoot. —Hooty
%
If you want this to end as you say, three must hold hands, it's the only way. —Hooty
%
Hey, I'm a refined taste! Hoot hoot. —Hooty
%
Is the room spinning or is it just me? Ah. Just a little house humor. —Hooty
%
It's okay. I'm just glad I was included. —Hooty
%
Ding‐dong. Ding. Hoot hoot! —Hooty
%
Hey, you wanna hear about MY night??? —Hooty
%
Hoot house, Hooty hooting. —Hooty
%
Oh, wow. I've been waiting for someone to call all day, and now it's finally happened! We can talk for hours, and hours, and hours, and hours... —Hooty
%
Guys? Today's my monthly cleaning. Hoot, hoot. I'm 20% mucus, but don't let that stop you. C'mon, I have so many hard‐to‐reach spots that need swabbing! —Hooty
%
Sweet moves, little dude! —Hooty
%
I forget I'm here too... boop. —Hooty
%
I chew insects. I turn them into mush. —Hooty
%
It's MY birthday! —Hooty
%
And I love you, Lu-- Ah! —Hooty
%
It's your faithful pal Hooty reporting for duty! Up at dawn, taking orders all day long! —Hooty
%
Wow, this is incredible! It's so real! You got yourself a deal! —Hooty
%
Sir, the honor is all mine. —Hooty
%
You'll never understand what we've been through together! Never! Never! —Hooty
%
I will be haunted by my actions forever. Hoot hoot! —Hooty
%
Hey! Guess what's been in my mouth that I'm about to throw up! THE MAIL! —Hooty
%
Oh, a fly! Talk to me, talk to me! —Hooty
%
Boy, fly, we sure get into some wacky hijinks, don't we? Sure feel sorry for anyone that missed seeing us two rabble-rousers getting into scrapes. Good thing I brought a camera. Yep. Hooty and fly. Together forever. You and me. Every single day-- —Hooty
%
Now I know what friendship taste like. Yum. Taste like a bug. —Hooty
%
Maybe I can help! I'm pretty good at getting stuck inside people's heads! —Hooty
%
I've been waiting to hear those words all my life! Where to begin? It all started with a hunt. Blood red skies. That's right, I was... —Hooty
%
My first word was Hoot. My second word was hoot hoot. My third word... —Hooty
%
Here's a song I wrote! Bored bored bored, bored bored bored. —Hooty
%
Here a hoot, there a hoot, somewhere else a hoot hoot, hooty-hoot hoot! —Hooty
%
Hoot hoot, Luz! Time to fill up that darling little head of yours with... Mm-hmm. Delicious knowledge! —Hooty
%
YOU WANNA HEAR MY WORST NIGHTMARE??? —Hooty
%
Hoot-hoot! Guess who found a special friend in the forest! It was me. Hoot! —Hooty
%
HOOTY! —Hooty
%
You gals ready to hoot? We want a clean game here, so no magic allowed! —Hooty
%
I’m an unbiased participant, hoot hoot! —Hooty
%
Sleepwalking... sleepwalking... Sleep-hooting! —Hooty
%
Hiya, Lilith! Peek-a-hoot! —Hooty
%
Sorry! Eda doesn't like trespassers, but I'm always here to make new friends! Hoot! Oh! Look at me! I'm a person now. Wobbly, wobbly! Ooh, blackout! Hoot hoot! Hoot hoot! Bye, friend! Ooh! I feel like dancing! Hoot! —Hooty
%
The roughhousing was fun, but I like this part of our playdates even better. —Hooty
%
A good friend would respect her wishes, but a better friend would help no matter what! —Hooty
%
I'm here for you, Lulu. No witch is an island. Now face my wrath! —Hooty
%
It's okay. I'm sorry for being all nosy-nosy. But hey, Lulu, every friendship comes with its ups and downs. Right, best friend? —Hooty
%
Toot toot! The Hexside train is a-coming! Chugga-chugga! —Hooty
%
A fresh cup of tea for my favorite cup of tea. That's you, Lulu. —Hooty
%
Ah, to die in your arms. Avenge me! —Hooty
%
Yeah! I'm a house of principles! You're asking me to lie? Hootrageous! —Hooty
%
Porta-Hooty! Reporting for Hooty! —Hooty
%
Ha! I've seen better graffiti. I've got better graffiti on me. —Hooty
%
More running, less stopping! —Hooty
%
Is this what regret feels like? I HATE IT! —Hooty
%
Special delivery! PAIN! —Hooty
%
Fear not, maiden. Hooty, the guardian owl of Ga'Hoot, has protected you once more! Ga'Hoot! —Hooty
%
You've always got Uncle Hooty's shoulder to lean on! —Hooty
%
LEAN ON ME!!! —Hooty
%
Let me be your emotional support! —Hooty
%
Whenst I wrote you last, I was in the throes of a malaise. That’s when I got your letter! —Hooty
%
Sounds like our little demon is becoming a de-MAN! —Hooty
%
You were right, Lulu. These three needed my help. So I devised the plan of plans. —Hooty
%
Are you angry? Sweaty? Is there hair in places? Does your voice crack in a super embarrassing way? I have the answers you seek! You're going through Demon Puberty! —Hooty
%
DO NOT INTERRUPT! —Hooty
%
DON'T YOU TALK ABOUT MY MOTHER!!! —Hooty
%
Well your dance was offensive, and your attempt to spin a cocoon was just… sad. Honestly. —Hooty
%
You... are you! —Hooty
%
The blood tests were inconclusive. We don’t really know what you are! But that’s okay! ‘Cause we don’t need to know that to be your friends! —Hooty
%
The only real answer is inside your heart! —Hooty
%
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A CRUMBLE!!! —Hooty
%
YUP! One bite will put you to sleep for hours! —Hooty
%
Luz’s heart was torn between finding a way home, and the pursuit of love. How do I know all that? I suppose I’m just attuned to other people’s emotions. She wasn’t going to make any progress if her attention was split. —Hooty
%
OUT! OUT, VILE OWL! RID THIS HOUSE OF THYSELF! —Hooty
%
NEVER SHALL I CURSE THIS HOME WITH MY ODIOUS PRESENCE AGAIN! —Hooty
%
I FAILED YOU ALL! I FAILED YOU ALL!!! —Hooty
%
They’re adorable, and deserve all the happiness! —Hooty
%
I had to promise never to help anyone ever again, but nevertheless, I’m a genius! —Hooty
%
Whoopsie! Hope that was junk mail! —Hooty
%
Well I've never heard of underground Korean hip-hop before! —Hooty
%
I can't wait to share parenting tips! —Hooty
%
How do we know she's cool, man? What do you think? —Jerbo
%
I tried mixing plant magic with abominations. Bump was not thrilled. —Jerbo
%
Your aura is strong and silly, like a baby's laughter —Jerbo
%
Lilith, I see you let The Owl Lady get the best of your temper. Just remember what Emperor Belos has promised to you. —Kikimora
%
The Day of Unity is fast approaching and other teams have bound many rogue witches to covens and yet, The Owl Lady still roams free. Are you...protecting her? —Kikimora
%
Children of Hexside, Emperor Belos welcomes you to his castle. We're honored by visits from students. You'll soon be a part of the coven, some lucky few may even find their home here, in the mighty Emperor's coven! —Kikimora
%
You...are the future of the Isles! My job is to teach you its past. —Kikimora
%
Today, the Isles are a place of peace and prosperity. But that wasn't always the case. Up until 50 years ago, Witches and Demons practiced wild magic during what we called the Savage Ages. Witches had access to corrupt knowledge, and that dishonored the Titan. That was, until our great Emperor ascended to the throne, and taught witches how to use magic properly. Our next stop is the Emperor's personal collection of relics. —Kikimora
%
Yes, and if I'm not mistaken, she's on her way to see the emperor himself. Let's all wish her luck! —Kikimora
%
Who dares intrude upon I, the King of Demons?! —King
%
Soon, Mr. Ducky, we shall drink the fear of those who mocked us. —King
%
Try to catch me when I’m covered in grease! I'm a squirmy little fella. —King
%
My crown! Yes, yes! I can feel my powers returning! You, there. Nightmare critter. I shall call you Francois, and you shall be a minion in my army of darkness. Ha‐ha! —King
%
Weh? —King
%
That was actually one of her better breakups! —King
%
I AM NOT YOUR CUTIE-PIE!!! —King
%
Ha! Good luck. The Boiling Isles is nothing but a cesspool of despair. —King
%
You should run a small business of more scones into my mouth. —King
%
Finally, all that mean-spirited laughter made me sleepy. —King
%
Less talky, more nappy. —King
%
Can't mistake her smell. Like lemons and young, naïve confidence. —King
%
I have no son! Eat salt! —King
%
Even demons have inner demons. —King
%
Look, now we're boo-boo buddies! —King
%
Bap! —King
%
Remember when her head got cut off last week? That woman can survive anything. She's probably just tired from staying up all night chasing shrews and voles. —King
%
Stay back. Hey, hey. I am the king of demons, okay? And as such, I demand you to barf my friends back up. —King
%
I'm so sorry, Luz. I just wanted you to be into demons like you're into magic. I don't have many friends, and no one even pays that much attention to me. I thought maybe if I taught you, finally, someone would care about creatures like me. —King
%
That voice. That horrific voice!!! —King
%
Show me the picture! Hah! I can draw better than that. You know, they once called me the King of Artists. —King
%
Are you bestowing gifts upon me? Yes! I accept your offering! The King of Demons is back! —King
%
Cupcakes in my tummy-tum makes the King say yummy-yum! —King
%
Mmm? Oh, yeah. No. —King
%
I'm stealing everything that's not nailed down! —King
%
King? Who's King? I go by Little Bone Boy now. —King
%
Rivals are meant to be annihilated not befriended. Now keep reading. I've been sucked into your awful fandom. —King
%
What does Luz know about problems anyway? All she has is dumb teen drama! She doesn't understand how hard some of us have it. —King
%
Well, I don't know if you realized, but I'm not a baby! —King
%
My life is a living nightmare! —King
%
Fight to the death! —King
%
I've got some... very confusing emotions right now. —King
%
All right, you acne‐encrusted hormone buckets. Let's go let out some teen angst! —King
%
Ooh! Fight, fight, fight! —King
%
Yes! Yes! This is a throne worthy of a tyrant. Bow to me you snotty underlings. Bow! —King
%
*Rage squeals* —King
%
Hey you scum! Which one of you wants to read my literary masterpiece? Anyone brave enough? —King
%
I've always wanted a people chair! I'm in! This will be my first step in my reclamation of power! —King
%
I'm sorry, my lawyer advised me not to look at unsolicited work. —King
%
What's a book? Good night! —King
%
Hey! Less ready, more scratchy! —King
%
Military discipline, cooking! Ha, I truly am a demon for all seasons! Just a dash of Eda's secret sauce and I'm the creator of life! —King
%
Welcome to boot camp! You sure need it. Look at you: raggedy, pathetic, chewed on, you got a button hangin' off of your eye. Pathetic! But I'll mold you worms into... slightly... better kinds of worms. Your first mission: gimme snacks! Your commander is hungry, so pick it up! —King
%
This day shall live in infamy. —King
%
Private Hooty, today when the felt flew you showed grit and determination that were instrumental in securing our victory. May I just say, it has been an honor, to be your commander. —King
%
Obedience? Well, what is a teacher if not an authority figure? A king of children, if you will. Yes! I am your teacher! You may call me Mr. King! —King
%
Assume a coefficient of ten, carry the two, solve for Y, and that is the way to steal a pie from a windowsill! Also you can eat trash. —King
%
Alright. Read chapters three to five on the right way to scratch yourself in public. Spoiler alert: There's no wrong way! Ah, days like these make being a teacher all worth it. —King
%
Oh dear, I've gotten a tube stuck on my nose! Will I ever eat again? Looks like I'm toast! —King
%
The King of Demons misses nobody! I wouldn't care if she came through this door right now! —King
%
Beat up the man and steal his things for me! —King
%
I'd say that sounds illegal. I would also say... go on. —King
%
Willow, Gus, I'm sorry for poofing you. And Luz, I'm sorry for taking away your friends. I know you'll eventually go home and now you're spending more time at school. I just... wanna be around you! —King
%
I'm sorry, Luz. Demons do crazy things when they've been missing somebody. —King
%
I'm gonna bake that kid into a pie! —King
%
Senseless violence. Yes, attack! DEATH IS YOUR GOD! —King
%
I FORGE MY OWN PATH! —King
%
Why am I doing this? I don't even wear clothes! —King
%
We're going to turn this blood-bath into a fun-bath! —King
%
Girl, you can pull off anything! Up top! We're style geniuses! —King
%
Oh, oh gosh. Um... whoooo. Wow, these lights are warm. Observe! Luz, is um... she's down there, all right. And, uh, yes she is! There she goes! Folks, she's battling the thing, and uh... —King
%
I know, I know. Imagine everyone in their underwear. —King
%
And there you have it, folks. A happy ending for this year's Grom. Let's give a big hand to our Grom queens, Luz and Amity! —King
%
Yes! Now I’ll strike fear into my enemies with this armor of intimidation. —King
%
You know what, when she first got here, I thought we were gonna eat her. But now I only think of that, like, sometimes. —King
%
The cake is me! —King
%
Me and Eda don't always see eye to eye, but I do consider her family. I want her back as much as you do. —King
%
We'll have to do something so diabolical, so criminally insane, that they'll have to send us to the Conformatorium. —King
%
I'm never letting you go! You're never returning to the human realm! —King
%
King want a cracker! —King
%
Weh? Yeah yeah, I'll deal with it. No one ever said power came with responsibility... —King
%
The King of Demons yields to no one! —King
%
I was once the mighty King of Demons. I was beloved almost as much as I was feared. But one dark day, an evil spell was cast... transforming me into this. —King
%
Ah, the chamber where I would devour the hearts of my foes. The taste was cold and bitter, but I bet yours would be sweet, Luz. —King
%
Everyone lied! And I was too caught up in the fantasy to realize it? I... I don't know what to do, Luz? I can't tell what's real and what's fake! —King
%
This stinks. If my dad doesn't care about me, why should I care about him? Hmm? Well, I'm not going to him. He's gonna have to come to me! —King
%
Is that a six-footed pig or a floating appendage? Why, no! It's Gus the Illusion Master. Please leave a message. —King
%
Just squeeze it out! —King
%
And weh, and weh, and weh, and weh, and weh, and weh, and weh, and weh! —King
%
Haha! Saint Epiderm? More like Stank Epiderm! —King
%
DID YOU OWL PELLET ME?! —King
%
I don’t need you to tell me to love myself, Hooty. I want to know where I came from. What my Dad looked like. What I’ll look like when I grow up. I don’t have any responses to my video, yet, or my wanted posters. Maybe my Dad is gone, maybe there’s no one else like me, and I’ll live my whole life without any answers! —King

You look like one of my hairballs. Let's just do the trench coat thing! —King
%
Guess minecart chases are a lot more dangerous than video games make'em seem. —King
%
I can't wait to eat HUMAN snacks! —King
%
I like editing anime clips to music and reading fantasy books with convoluted backstories. —Luz Noceda
%
Where am I? Did I die? Am I in the bad place? —Luz Noceda
%
Flying staffs. Crazy monsters. You're a witch?! —Luz Noceda
%
This is clearly not the PG fantasy world I always dreamed about. —Luz Noceda
%
I hate everything you're saying right now. —Luz Noceda
%
So, you have a different way of doing things, a different way of seeing things. That might make you weird, but it also makes you awesome. Don't you see? —Luz Noceda
%
Because us weirdos have to stick together. And nobody should be punished for who they are! —Luz Noceda
%
Do not underestimate me, Warden Wrath, for I am Luz, the human, warrior of peace. Now eat this, sucker! —Luz Noceda
%
I don't fit in at home. You don't fit in here. If I stay, we could not fit in together. —Luz Noceda
%
If you teach me to become a witch, I'll do anything you want. —Luz Noceda
%
This is it, old girl! Your first day on the Boiling Isles, as a witch apprentice! —Luz Noceda
%
I won't let you down, Miss Eda. —Luz Noceda
%
Ooh, hoo, hoo! This quest is questing in all the right ways. —Luz Noceda
%
I am a Witch's Apprentice. And I'm gonna earn my magic staff the hard way. I believed you, Magic Man. Now feel my wrath! —Luz Noceda
%
I may be your abomination, but you're my a‐mom‐ination. —Luz Noceda
%
Viral fame is a worthy pursuit. Your cat would never eat you if it got the chance. Chemtrails are real‐‐ —Luz Noceda
%
Oh, Eda, have I told you how rad your fang looks today? —Luz Noceda
%
I was a nobody back home. But becoming a witch is my chance to be someone. Do you know what it's like to have no one take you seriously? —Luz Noceda
%
I'm still figuring this world out so I'm going to make up my own mind, ok? —Luz Noceda
%
I'm receiving magic lessons from a powerful witch and a ferocious demon. —Luz Noceda
%
I'll tell you what, Amity. It's one thing to say I can't be a witch, but it's another thing to bully my friends. Just like The Good Witch Azura said when facing down her rival Hecate at the Bog of Immediate Regret, I challenge you to a Witch's Duel! —Luz Noceda
%
I'm not a witch. But I'm training hard to be one. —Luz Noceda
%
Oh boy, cards! The paper rectangles that old people think are fun! —Luz Noceda
%
How is this detention?! This is a death sentence! —Luz Noceda
%
Don't you dare insult shipping in my presence! —Luz Noceda
%
Amity! Oh Cramity! —Luz Noceda
%
Amity Blight... I'll do it. I'll take your place and face Grom in the arena. I'll be your fearless champion! —Luz Noceda
%
Yeah, right! You going soft on me, Blight? —Luz Noceda
%
Cheating isn't anything to brag about. How do you know you were any good if all you did was cheat your way to victory? —Luz Noceda
%
That just invalidates all our efforts! If catching that thing is so important, why do anything else!? There's no reason to watch any of the other players! THAT'S SUCH A STUPID RULE!! —Luz Noceda
%
Aaand scoop! —Luz Noceda
%
Ah, boo‐hoo. I'm sorry. "I'm the new kid". "I want friends". Ha! No. I want power. —Mattholomule
%
Welcome to my world. Believe it or not, at my old school, I was at detention plenty of times. —Mattholomule
%
I think the student body could learn a lot from having an exchange student. —Principal Bump
%
Oh, hi. I didn’t see you there. I’m Principal Hieronymous Bump, and welcome to Hexside School of Magic and Demonics, where our students' safety and well-being is our top priority. Let's take a tour. Here at Hexside, we are devoted to providing the very best for our students, from our state of the art classrooms... —Principal Bump
%
She helped me love teaching again... After she left. —Principal Bump
%
I hate this game! —Skara
%
Friendship is the real magic. —Skara
%
I'm the one they call Grimm Hammer. Welcome, welcome, welcome. I've got weaponry from the Hinterlands, curses from the Winterlands, and jelly beans. —Tibbles
%
Tibblet‐Tibblie Grimm Hammer III. Please, call me Tibbles. —Tibbles
%
Capitalism! Where everyone wins, except you. —Tibbles
%
Curse you, witch! Curse you, bone boy. I'll have my revenge. Tibblet‐Tibblie Grimm Hammer III will have his revenge! —Tibbles
%
No, no, no. I should thank you. After my stand was destroyed, I re-evaluated my life and found my true calling! I'm now ringmaster of... Tibbles's Tent of Tiny Terrors! —Tibbles
%
When you destroyed my stand, you destroyed generations of Grimm Hammer history. Now it's time to pay. —Tibbles
%
You ruined my livelihood. So now, you'll feed my livelihood. —Tibbles
%
Place your bets and enjoy the show! —Tibbles
%
No refunds. —Tibbles
%
It's the Tent of Tiny Terrors. Something needed to be tiny. —Tibbles
%
Oh, no! Not desserts! —Tibbles
%
We are agents of fwee expwession! They will never siwence us! —Tiny Nose
%
The world is a simuwation! We are but pwaythings for a higher being! —Tiny Nose
%
Fight against the oppwessor! We will wesist! We will conquer! We will never be afwaid of you, you old cweep! Hooway! I'm fwee! —Tiny Nose
%
Self-doubt is a pwison you can never escape fwom.. —Tiny Nose
%
I think the world is a twiangle! —Tiny Nose
%
We awe victowious! —Tiny Nose
%
I am the destwoyer of worlds! —Tiny Nose
%
Ooh! Ahh! —Tiny Nose
%
Thanks for standing up for us back there. Not many people would do that. Follow me! I wanna show you something. You're one of us troublemakers now, so you'll get special access to the Secret Room of Shortcuts! —Viney
%
This place connects the different parts of the school. We found it after being thrown in the detention track. The witch who made it is known as Lord Calamity. —Viney
%
You can do it. Even if you get a bad grade, it's not a reflection of you as a witch. And my parents are right. There are better opportunities on this track. Now, get to school! Oh, no! Oh, little friend! I'm sorry! —Willow Park
%
"Oh, see you in class, superstar!" I hate when she does that. I hate making abominations. I hate getting bad grades. Ugh! I can't stand this anymore. —Willow Park
%
You're human! This is astounding! A human on the Boiling Isles! How'd you get here? What are you doing here? —Willow Park
%
I may get detention, but you'll get dissected. —Willow Park
%
And best of all, we've got actual friends to do the conjuring with! This is so exciting! —Willow Park
%
Luz, I'm so sorry. You wanted to turn back but I just had to show off to Amity. The truth is she and I used to be friends. —Willow Park
%
We played together as kids, but when she got her magical powers and I didn't, she stopped hanging out with me. —Willow Park
%
Because up close, everything is hairy. —Willow Park
%
I was. Love, sadness, fear, I used to be made of all emotions. But ever since you set Willow’s mind on fire, all I've felt is ''anger''! —Willow Park
%
I remember what you did too, what you did in there. I can’t say we’re friends, but it’s... a start. —Willow Park
